Learning track 1: Drug discovery

Proteins play a crucial role in biological processes, making them prime targets in drug discovery, especially for cancer therapies. The drug discovery process involves identifying proteins that are dysregulated or altered in cancer, leading to uncontrolled cell growth. By targeting these proteins, drugs can interrupt cancer progression.

A notable example is the BCR-ABL fusion protein found in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). This protein functions as a continuously active tyrosine kinase, driving the proliferation of leukemic cells. The development of imatinib, a small molecule that specifically targets BCR-ABL, has transformed CML treatment, achieving high remission rates (Druker _et al_., 2001).

Another significant target is the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Mutations in the EGFR gene result in persistent activation of signaling pathways that encourage tumor growth. Drugs like erlotinib and gefitinib target these mutations, providing substantial benefits to patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC (Paez _et al_., 2004).

The drug discovery process typically begins with identifying the active site of the target protein, which is the site where a drug can bind and exert its effect. Techniques such as molecular docking and virtual screening are used to predict how small molecules interact with these active sites, thereby speeding up the discovery of potential drugs (Gohlke and Klebe, 2002).

Pharmacophore modeling is another vital technique that helps identify the key features necessary for a molecule to interact with a specific protein target (Schneider and Guba, 2002). Combined with Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) analysis, this approach allows researchers to predict the activity of new compounds based on their chemical structures (Tropsha, 2010).

Cheminformatics, which involves the use of computational tools to store, analyze, and retrieve chemical data, is essential for managing the vast data generated in drug discovery (Brown, 2009). Autodock Vina, a popular molecular docking software, enables researchers to simulate the binding of ligands to their protein targets (Trott and Olson, 2010).

Ligand-based drug discovery focuses on identifying new drug candidates based on existing knowledge of molecules that bind to the target protein (Lowe, 2017). G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), a large protein family, are common drug targets due to their role in signal transduction (Lagerström and Schiöth, 2008). The RCSB Protein Data Bank (RCSB PDB) is a critical resource that offers access to 3D protein structures, aiding drug design (Berman _et al_., 2000).

Understanding the dynamics between agonists, which activate a protein's function, and antagonists, which inhibit it, is essential in designing effective drugs (Kenakin, 2004). Furthermore, adherence to Lipinski's Rule of Five is crucial in ensuring that compounds possess properties favorable for good pharmacokinetics (Lipinski _et al_., 1997). Additionally, assessing ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) profiles is key to developing safe and effective drugs (Kola and Landis, 2004).

Targeting proteins is fundamental in cancer drug discovery. Identifying and validating these targets, combined with advanced technologies like AlphaFold, has led to more effective and targeted cancer treatments (Jumper _et al_., 2021). As our understanding of cancer biology grows, the development of new protein-targeted therapies will remain a vital focus in combating cancer.
